            <h1>About Willow & Paw Photography</h1>

<p class="about-intro">
  Dogs and animals have always been something I’ve cared deeply about — ever since I was a child.
  They have an incredible way of connecting with us, offering comfort, joy, and companionship
  without asking for anything in return.
</p>

<p>
  That lifelong appreciation for animals is at the heart of everything I do at
  <em>Willow & Paw Photography</em>.
</p>

<h2>My photography journey</h2>

<p>
  My journey into photography began properly around 2008, when I picked up my first DSLR.
  I was immediately drawn to landscape photography, and I still enjoy it as a creative outlet today.
</p>

<p>
  From there, my focus naturally expanded into wildlife and bird photography — learning patience,
  observation, and how to work quietly within an animal’s space rather than interrupting it.
</p>

<h2>Why dogs?</h2>

<p>
  Photographing dogs felt like a natural progression. Dogs are full of expression,
  personality, and character — and they’re simply a joy to be around.
</p>

<h2>My approach</h2>

<p>
  My approach is calm, patient, and always guided by the dog in front of me.
  During each session, I gently guide dogs into natural positions without ever forcing a moment.
</p>

<p>
  Sessions are unhurried and flexible. If your dog needs time to explore, settle, or take a break,
  that’s absolutely fine — their comfort and wellbeing always come first.
</p>

<p class="about-closing">
  At Willow & Paw Photography, it’s not about perfect behaviour or rigid poses —
  it’s about capturing dogs as they truly are.
