            <h1>About Willow & Paw Photography</h1>
<br>
<br>Dogs and animals have always been something I’ve cared deeply about — ever since I was a child. They have an incredible way of connecting with us, offering comfort, joy, and companionship without asking for anything in return. That lifelong appreciation for animals is at the heart of everything I do at Willow & Paw Photography.
<br>
<br>My journey into photography began properly around 2008, when I picked up my first DSLR. I was immediately drawn to landscape photography, and I still enjoy it as a creative outlet today. From there, my focus naturally expanded into wildlife and bird photography — learning patience, observation, and how to work quietly within an animal’s space rather than interrupting it.
<br>
<br>Photographing dogs felt like a natural progression. Dogs are full of expression, personality, and character, and they’re simply a joy to be around. Combining my love for animals with photography allowed me to create images that feel genuine, relaxed, and full of life.
<br>
<br>My approach is calm, patient, and always guided by the dog in front of me. During each session, I gently guide dogs into natural positions and situations that help them look their best, without ever forcing a moment. Sessions are unhurried and flexible — if your dog needs time to explore, settle, or take a break, that’s absolutely fine. Their comfort and wellbeing always come first.
<br>
<br>At Willow & Paw Photography, it’s not about perfect behaviour or rigid poses — it’s about capturing dogs as they truly are, and preserving the connection you share in a way that feels honest and timeless.
